OWN AUDITOR HE HAD HEARD MY STORY WITH THAT HALF KIND OF BELIEF THAT IS GIVEN TO A TALE OF SPIRITS AND SUPERNATURAL EVENTS BUT WHEN HE WAS CALLED UPON TO ACT OFFICIALLY IN CONSEQUENCE THE WHOLE TIDE OF HIS INCREDULITY RETURNED HE HOWEVER ANSWERED MILDLY I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOU EVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TO HAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE WHO CAN FOLLOW AN ANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERE NO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE BESIDES SOME MONTHS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HE HAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT AND IF HE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOIS AND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOT CREDIT MY NARRATIVE AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE I CONFESS THAT IT IS THE DEVOURING AND ONLY PASSION OF MY SOUL MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED BUT TO A GENEVAN MAGISTRATE WHOSE MIND WAS OCCUPIED BY FAR OTHER IDEAS THAN THOSE OF DEVOTION AND HEROISM THIS ELEVATION OF MIND HAD MUCH THE APPEARANCE OF MADNESS HE ENDEAVOURED TO SOOTHE ME AS A NURSE DOES A CHILD AND REVERTED TO MY TALE AS THE EFFECTS OF DELIRIUM MAN I CRIED HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE YOU KNOW NOT WHAT IT IS YOU SAY I BROKE FROM THE HOUSE ANGRY AND DISTURBED AND RETIRED TO MEDITATE ON SOME OTHER MODE OF ACTION CHAPTER MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY REVENGE ALONE ENDOWED ME WITH STRENGTH AND COMPOSURE IT MOULDED MY FEELINGS AND ALLOWED ME TO BE CALCULATING AND CALM AT PERIODS WHEN OTHERWISE DELIRIUM OR DEATH WOULD HAVE BEEN MY PORTION MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOR EVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE I HAVE TRAVERSED A VAST PORTION OF THE EARTH AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW MANY TIMES HAVE I STRETCHED MY FAILING LIMBS UPON THE SANDY PLAIN AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR WAS TO GAIN SOME CLUE BY WHICH I MIGHT TRACE THE STEPS OF MY FIENDISH ENEMY BUT MY PLAN WAS UNSETTLED AND I WANDERED MANY HOURS ROUND THE CONFINES OF THE TOWN UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND AND TO CAST A SHADOW WHICH WAS FELT BUT NOT SEEN AROUND THE HEAD OF THE MOURNER THE DEEP GRIEF WHICH THIS SCENE HAD AT FIRST EXCITED QUICKLY GAVE WAY TO RAGE AND DESPAIR THEY WERE DEAD AND I LIVED THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE D MON WHO CAUSED THIS MISERY UNTIL HE OR I SHALL PERISH IN MORTAL CONFLICT FOR THIS PURPOSE I WILL PRESERVE MY LIFE TO EXECUTE THIS DEAR REVENGE WILL I AGAIN BEHOLD THE SUN AND TREAD THE GREEN HERBAGE OF EARTH WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOR EVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK LET THE CURSED AND HELLISH MONSTER DRINK DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE I WAS ANSWERED THROUGH THE STILLNESS OF NIGHT BY A LOUD AND FIENDISH LAUGH IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER SURELY IN THAT MOMENT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN POSSESSED BY FRENZY AND HAVE DESTROYED MY MISERABLE EXISTENCE BUT THAT MY VOW WAS HEARD AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR ADDRESSED ME IN AN AUDIBLE WHISPER I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK GUIDED BY A SLIGHT CLUE I FOLLOWED THE WINDINGS OF THE RHONE BUT VAINLY THE BLUE MEDITERRANEAN APPEARED AND BY A STRANGE CHANCE I SAW THE FIEND ENTER BY NIGHT AND HIDE HIMSELF IN A VESSEL BOUND FOR THE BLACK SEA I TOOK MY PASSAGE IN THE SAME SHIP BUT HE ESCAPED I KNOW NOT HOW AMIDST THE WILDS OF TARTARY AND RUSSIA ALTHOUGH HE STILL EVADED ME I HAVE EVER FOLLOWED IN HIS TRACK SOMETIMES THE PEASANTS SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAVE FELT AND STILL FEEL COLD WANT AND FATIGUE WERE THE LEAST PAINS WHICH I WAS DESTINED TO ENDURE I WAS CURSED BY SOME DEVIL AND CARRIED ABOUT WITH ME MY ETERNAL HELL YET STILL A SPIRIT OF GOOD FOLLOWED AND DIRECTED MY STEPS AND WHEN I MOST MURMURED WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE BUT I WILL NOT DOUBT THAT IT WAS SET THERE BY THE SPIRITS THAT I HAD INVOKED TO AID ME OFTEN WHEN ALL WAS DRY THE HEAVENS CLOUDLESS AND I WAS PARCHED BY THIRST A SLIGHT CLOUD WOULD BEDIM THE SKY SHED THE FEW DROPS THAT REVIVED ME AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE D MON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED IN OTHER PLACES HUMAN BEINGS WERE SELDOM SEEN AND I GENERALLY SUBSISTED ON THE WILD ANIMALS THAT CROSSED MY PATH I HAD MONEY WITH ME AND GAINED THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE VILLAGERS BY DISTRIBUTING IT OR I BROUGHT WITH ME SOME FOOD THAT I HAD KILLED WHICH AFTER TAKING A SMALL PART I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE DEPRIVED OF THIS RESPITE I SHOULD HAVE SUNK UNDER MY HARDSHIPS DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETH S VOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BY A TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD COME AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONISING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM HOW DID I CLING TO THEIR DEAR FORMS AS SOMETIMES THEY HAUNTED EVEN MY WAKING HOURS AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE D MON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW SOMETIMES INDEED HE LEFT MARKS IN WRITING ON THE BARKS OF THE TREES OR CUT IN STONE THAT GUIDED ME AND INSTIGATED MY FURY MY REIGN IS NOT YET OVER THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE EAT AND BE REFRESHED COME ON MY ENEMY WE HAVE YET TO WRESTLE FOR OUR LIVES BUT MANY HARD AND MISERABLE HOURS MUST YOU ENDURE UNTIL THAT PERIOD SHALL ARRIVE SCOFFING DEVIL AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY SHALL I JOIN MY ELIZABETH AND MY DEPARTED FRIENDS WHO EVEN NOW PREPARE FOR ME THE REWARD OF MY TEDIOUS TOIL AND HORRIBLE PILGRIMAGE AS I STILL PURSUED MY JOURNEY TO THE NORTHWARD THE SNOWS THICKENED AND THE COLD INCREASED IN A DEGREE ALMOST TOO SEVERE TO SUPPORT THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS I RESOLVED NOT TO FAIL IN MY PURPOSE AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THE SOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BY ITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED I KNOW NOT WHETHER THE FIEND POSSESSED THE SAME ADVANTAGES BUT I FOUND THAT AS BEFORE I HAD DAILY LOST GROUND IN THE PURSUIT I NOW GAINED ON HIM SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN I FIRST SAW THE OCEAN HE WAS BUT ONE DAY S JOURNEY IN ADVANCE AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED THAT HE MUST SPEEDILY BE DESTROYED BY THE BREAKING OF THE ICE OR FROZEN BY THE ETERNAL FROSTS ON HEARING THIS INFORMATION I SUFFERED A TEMPORARY ACCESS OF DESPAIR HE HAD ESCAPED ME AND I MUST COMMENCE A DESTRUCTIVE AND ALMOST ENDLESS JOURNEY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINOUS ICES OF THE OCEAN AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE I PREPARED FOR MY JOURNEY I EXCHANGED MY LAND SLEDGE FOR ONE FASHIONED FOR THE INEQUALITIES OF THE FROZEN OCEAN AND PURCHASING A PLENTIFUL STOCK OF PROVISIONS I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT OF A JUST RETRIBUTION BURNING WITHIN MY HEART COULD HAVE ENABLED ME TO SUPPORT IMMENSE AND RUGGED MOUNTAINS OF ICE OFTEN BARRED UP MY PASSAGE AND I OFTEN HEARD THE THUNDER OF THE GROUND SEA WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE BY THE QUANTITY OF PROVISION WHICH I HAD CONSUMED I SHOULD GUESS THAT I HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTION OF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OF DESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN I STRAINED MY SIGHT TO DISCOVER WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN OH WITH WHAT A BURNING GUSH DID HOPE REVISIT MY HEART WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE D MON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL GIVING WAY TO THE EMOTIONS THAT OPPRESSED ME I WEPT ALOUD BUT THIS WAS NOT THE TIME FOR DELAY I DISENCUMBERED THE DOGS OF THEIR DEAD COMPANION GAVE THEM A PLENTIFUL PORTION OF FOOD AND AFTER AN HOUR S REST WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND YET WHICH WAS BITTERLY IRKSOME TO ME I CONTINUED MY ROUTE THE SLEDGE WAS STILL VISIBLE NOR DID I AGAIN LOSE SIGHT OF IT EXCEPT AT THE MOMENTS WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY I BEHELD MY ENEMY AT NO MORE THAN A MILE DISTANT MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE A GROUND SEA WAS HEARD THE THUNDER OF ITS PROGRESS AS THE WATERS ROLLED AND SWELLED BENEATH ME BECAME EVERY MOMENT MORE OMINOUS AND TERRIFIC I PRESSED ON BUT IN VAIN THE WIND AROSE THE SEA ROARED AND AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH IN THIS MANNER MANY APPALLING HOURS PASSED SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR AND HOLDING FORTH TO ME HOPES OF SUCCOUR AND LIFE I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP I HAD DETERMINED IF YOU WERE GOING SOUTHWARDS STILL TO TRUST MYSELF TO THE MERCY OF THE SEAS RATHER THAN ABANDON MY PURPOSE I HOPED TO INDUCE YOU TO GRANT ME A BOAT WITH WHICH I COULD PURSUE MY ENEMY BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MY VIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIED HARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED OH WHEN WILL MY GUIDING SPIRIT IN CONDUCTING ME TO THE D MON ALLOW ME THE REST I SO MUCH DESIRE OR MUST I DIE AND HE YET LIVE IF I DO SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO I AM NOT SO SELFISH YET WHEN I AM DEAD IF HE SHOULD APPEAR IF THE MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIM TO YOU SWEAR THAT HE SHALL NOT LIVE SWEAR THAT HE SHALL NOT TRIUMPH OVER MY ACCUMULATED WOES AND SURVIVE TO ADD TO THE LIST OF HIS DARK CRIMES HE IS ELOQUENT AND PERSUASIVE AND ONCE HIS WORDS HAD EVEN POWER OVER MY HEART BUT TRUST HIM NOT HIS SOUL IS AS HELLISH AS HIS FORM FULL OF TREACHERY AND FIEND LIKE MALICE HEAR HIM NOT CALL ON THE NAMES OF WILLIAM JUSTINE CLERVAL ELIZABETH MY FATHER AND OF THE WRETCHED VICTOR AND THRUST YOUR SWORD INTO HIS HEART I WILL HOVER NEAR AND DIRECT THE STEEL ARIGHT WALTON IN CONTINUATION AUGUST TH YOU HAVE READ THIS STRANGE AND TERRIFIC STORY MARGARET AND DO YOU NOT FEEL YOUR BLOOD CONGEAL WITH HORROR LIKE THAT WHICH EVEN NOW CURDLES MINE SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS TALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITH DIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH HIS FINE AND LOVELY EYES WERE NOW LIGHTED UP WITH INDIGNATION NOW SUBDUED TO DOWNCAST SORROW AND QUENCHED IN INFINITE WRETCHEDNESS SOMETIMES HE COMMANDED HIS COUNTENANCE AND TONES AND RELATED THE MOST HORRIBLE INCIDENTS WITH A TRANQUIL VOICE SUPPRESSING EVERY MARK OF AGITATION THEN LIKE A VOLCANO BURSTING FORTH HIS FACE WOULD SUDDENLY CHANGE TO AN EXPRESSION OF THE WILDEST RAGE AS HE SHRIEKED OUT IMPRECATIONS ON HIS PERSECUTOR HIS TALE IS CONNECTED AND TOLD WITH AN APPEARANCE OF THE SIMPLEST TRUTH YET I OWN TO YOU THAT THE LETTERS OF FELIX AND SAFIE WHICH HE SHOWED ME AND THE APPARITION OF THE MONSTER SEEN FROM OUR SHIP BROUGHT TO ME A GREATER CONVICTION OF THE TRUTH OF HIS NARRATIVE THAN HIS ASSEVERATIONS HOWEVER EARNEST AND CONNECTED SUCH A MONSTER HAS THEN REALLY EXISTENCE I CANNOT DOUBT IT YET I AM LOST IN SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION SOMETIMES I ENDEAVOURED TO GAIN FROM FRANKENSTEIN THE PARTICULARS OF HIS CREATURE S FORMATION BUT ON THIS POINT HE WAS IMPENETRABLE ARE YOU MAD MY FRIEND SAID HE OR WHITHER DOES YOUR SENSELESS CURIOSITY LEAD YOU WOULD YOU ALSO CREATE FOR YOURSELF AND THE WORLD A DEMONIACAL ENEMY PEACE PEACE LEARN MY MISERIES AND DO NOT SEEK TO INCREASE YOUR OWN FRANKENSTEIN DISCOVERED THAT I MADE NOTES CONCERNING HIS HISTORY HE ASKED TO SEE THEM AND THEN HIMSELF CORRECTED AND AUGMENTED THEM IN MANY PLACES BUT PRINCIPALLY IN GIVING THE LIFE AND SPIRIT TO THE CONVERSATIONS HE HELD WITH HIS ENEMY SINCE YOU HAVE PRESERVED MY NARRATION SAID HE I WOULD NOT THAT A MUTILATED ONE SHOULD GO DOWN TO POSTERITY THUS HAS A WEEK PASSED AWAY WHILE I HAVE LISTENED TO THE STRANGEST TALE THAT EVER IMAGINATION FORMED MY THOUGHTS AND EVERY FEELING OF MY SOUL HAVE BEEN DRUNK UP BY THE INTEREST FOR MY GUEST WHICH THIS TALE AND HIS OWN ELEVATED AND GENTLE MANNERS HAVE CREATED I WISH TO SOOTHE HIM YET CAN I COUNSEL ONE SO INFINITELY MISERABLE SO DESTITUTE OF EVERY HOPE OF CONSOLATION TO LIVE OH NO THE ONLY JOY THAT HE CAN NOW KNOW WILL BE WHEN HE COMPOSES HIS SHATTERED SPIRIT TO PEACE AND DEATH YET HE ENJOYS ONE COMFORT THE OFFSPRING OF SOLITUDE AND DELIRIUM HE BELIEVES THAT WHEN IN DREAMS HE HOLDS CONVERSE WITH HIS FRIENDS AND DERIVES FROM THAT COMMUNION CONSOLATION FOR HIS MISERIES OR EXCITEMENTS TO HIS VENGEANCE THAT THEY ARE NOT THE CREATIONS OF HIS FANCY BUT THE BEINGS THEMSELVES WHO VISIT HIM FROM THE REGIONS OF A REMOTE WORLD THIS FAITH GIVES A SOLEMNITY TO HIS REVERIES THAT RENDER THEM TO ME ALMOST AS IMPOSING AND INTERESTING AS TRUTH OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFINED TO HIS OWN HISTORY AND MISFORTUNES ON EVERY POINT OF GENERAL LITERATURE HE DISPLAYS UNBOUNDED KNOWLEDGE AND A QUICK AND PIERCING APPREHENSION HIS ELOQUENCE IS FORCIBLE AND TOUCHING NOR CAN I HEAR HIM WHEN HE RELATES A PATHETIC INCIDENT OR ENDEAVOURS TO MOVE THE PASSIONS OF PITY OR LOVE WITHOUT TEARS WHAT A GLORIOUS CREATURE MUST HE HAVE BEEN IN THE DAYS OF HIS PROSPERITY WHEN HE IS THUS NOBLE AND GODLIKE IN RUIN HE SEEMS TO FEEL HIS OWN WORTH AND THE GREATNESS OF HIS FALL WHEN YOUNGER SAID HE I BELIEVED MYSELF DESTINED FOR SOME GREAT ENTERPRISE MY FEELINGS ARE PROFOUND BUT I POSSESSED A COOLNESS OF JUDGMENT THAT FITTED ME FOR ILLUSTRIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS THIS SENTIMENT OF THE WORTH OF MY NATURE SUPPORTED ME WHEN OTHERS WOULD HAVE BEEN OPPRESSED FOR I DEEMED IT CRIMINAL TO THROW AWAY IN USELESS GRIEF THOSE TALENTS THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO MY FELLOW CREATURES WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE WORK I HAD COMPLETED NO LESS A ONE THAN THE CREATION OF A SENSITIVE AND RATIONAL ANIMAL I COULD NOT RANK MYSELF WITH THE HERD OF COMMON PROJECTORS BUT THIS THOUGHT WHICH SUPPORTED ME IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY CAREER NOW SERVES ONLY TO PLUNGE ME LOWER IN THE DUST ALL MY SPECULATIONS AND HOPES ARE AS NOTHING AND LIKE THE ARCHANGEL WHO ASPIRED TO OMNIPOTENCE I AM CHAINED IN AN ETERNAL HELL MY IMAGINATION WAS VIVID YET MY POWERS OF ANALYSIS AND APPLICATION WERE INTENSE BY THE UNION OF THESE QUALITIES I CONCEIVED THE IDEA AND EXECUTED THE CREATION OF A MAN EVEN NOW I CANNOT RECOLLECT WITHOUT PASSION MY REVERIES WHILE THE WORK WAS INCOMPLETE I TROD HEAVEN IN MY THOUGHTS NOW EXULTING IN MY POWERS NOW BURNING WITH THE IDEA OF THEIR EFFECTS FROM MY INFANCY I WAS IMBUED WITH HIGH HOPES AND A LOFTY AMBITION BUT HOW AM I SUNK OH MY FRIEND IF YOU HAD KNOWN ME AS I ONCE WAS YOU WOULD NOT RECOGNISE ME IN THIS STATE OF DEGRADATION DESPONDENCY RARELY VISITED MY HEART A HIGH DESTINY SEEMED TO BEAR ME ON UNTIL I FELL NEVER NEVER AGAIN TO RISE MUST I THEN LOSE THIS ADMIRABLE BEING I HAVE LONGED FOR A FRIEND I HAVE SOUGHT ONE WHO WOULD SYMPATHISE WITH AND LOVE ME BEHOLD ON THESE DESERT SEAS I HAVE FOUND SUCH A ONE BUT I FEAR I HAVE GAINED HIM ONLY TO KNOW HIS VALUE AND LOSE HIM I WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO LIFE BUT HE REPULSES THE IDEA I THANK YOU WALTON HE SAID FOR YOUR KIND INTENTIONS TOWARDS SO MISERABLE A WRETCH BUT WHEN YOU SPEAK OF NEW TIES AND FRESH AFFECTIONS THINK YOU THAT ANY CAN REPLACE THOSE WHO ARE GONE CAN ANY MAN BE TO ME AS CLERVAL WAS OR ANY WOMAN ANOTHER ELIZABETH EVEN WHERE THE AFFECTIONS ARE NOT STRONGLY MOVED BY ANY SUPERIOR EXCELLENCE THE COMPANIONS OF OUR CHILDHOOD ALWAYS POSSESS A CERTAIN POWER OVER OUR MINDS WHICH HARDLY ANY LATER FRIEND CAN OBTAIN THEY KNOW OUR INFANTINE DISPOSITIONS WHICH HOWEVER THEY MAY BE AFTERWARDS MODIFIED ARE NEVER ERADICATED AND THEY CAN JUDGE OF OUR ACTIONS WITH MORE CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE INTEGRITY OF OUR MOTIVES A SISTER OR A BROTHER CAN NEVER UNLESS INDEED SUCH SYMPTOMS HAVE BEEN SHOWN EARLY SUSPECT THE OTHER OF FRAUD OR FALSE DEALING WHEN ANOTHER FRIEND HOWEVER STRONGLY HE MAY BE ATTACHED MAY IN SPITE OF HIMSELF BE CONTEMPLATED WITH SUSPICION BUT I ENJOYED FRIENDS DEAR NOT ONLY THROUGH HABIT AND ASSOCIATION BUT FROM THEIR OWN MERITS AND WHEREVER I AM THE SOOTHING VOICE OF MY ELIZABETH AND THE CONVERSATION OF CLERVAL WILL BE EVER WHISPERED IN MY EAR THEY ARE DEAD AND BUT ONE FEELING IN SUCH A SOLITUDE CAN PERSUADE ME TO PRESERVE MY LIFE IF I WERE ENGAGED IN ANY HIGH UNDERTAKING OR DESIGN FRAUGHT WITH EXTENSIVE UTILITY TO MY FELLOW CREATURES THEN COULD I LIVE TO FULFIL IT BUT SUCH IS NOT MY DESTINY I MUST PURSUE AND DESTROY THE BEING TO WHOM I GAVE EXISTENCE THEN MY LOT ON EARTH WILL BE FULFILLED AND I MAY DIE MY BELOVED SISTER SEPTEMBER D I WRITE TO YOU ENCOMPASSED BY PERIL AND IGNORANT WHETHER I AM EVER DOOMED TO SEE AGAIN DEAR ENGLAND AND THE DEARER FRIENDS THAT INHABIT IT I AM SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS OF ICE WHICH ADMIT OF NO ESCAPE AND THREATEN EVERY MOMENT TO CRUSH MY VESSEL THE BRAVE FELLOWS WHOM I HAVE PERSUADED TO BE MY COMPANIONS LOOK TOWARDS ME FOR AID BUT I HAVE NONE TO BESTOW THERE IS SOMETHING TERRIBLY APPALLING IN OUR SITUATION YET MY COURAGE AND HOPES DO NOT DESERT ME YET IT IS TERRIBLE TO REFLECT THAT THE LIVES OF ALL THESE MEN ARE ENDANGERED THROUGH ME IF WE ARE LOST MY MAD SCHEMES ARE THE CAUSE AND WHAT MARGARET WILL BE THE STATE OF YOUR MIND YOU WILL NOT HEAR OF MY DESTRUCTION AND YOU WILL ANXIOUSLY AWAIT MY RETURN YEARS WILL PASS AND YOU WILL HAVE VISITINGS OF DESPAIR AND YET BE TORTURED BY HOPE OH MY BELOVED SISTER THE SICKENING FAILING OF YOUR HEART FELT EXPECTATIONS IS IN PROSPECT MORE TERRIBLE TO ME THAN MY OWN DEATH BUT YOU HAVE A HUSBAND AND LOVELY CHILDREN YOU MAY BE HAPPY HEAVEN BLESS YOU AND MAKE YOU SO MY UNFORTUNATE GUEST REGARDS ME WITH THE TENDEREST COMPASSION HE ENDEAVOURS TO FILL ME WITH HOPE AND TALKS AS IF LIFE WERE A POSSESSION WHICH HE VALUED HE REMINDS ME HOW OFTEN THE SAME ACCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED TO OTHER NAVIGATORS WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED THIS SEA AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF HE FILLS ME WITH CHEERFUL AUGURIES EVEN THE SAILORS FEEL THE POWER OF HIS ELOQUENCE WHEN HE SPEAKS THEY NO LONGER DESPAIR HE ROUSES THEIR ENERGIES AND WHILE THEY HEAR HIS VOICE THEY BELIEVE THESE VAST MOUNTAINS OF ICE ARE MOLE HILLS WHICH WILL VANISH BEFORE THE RESOLUTIONS OF MAN THESE FEELINGS ARE TRANSITORY EACH DAY OF EXPECTATION DELAYED FILLS THEM WITH FEAR AND I ALMOST DREAD A MUTINY CAUSED BY THIS DESPAIR SEPTEMBER TH A SCENE HAS JUST PASSED OF SUCH UNCOMMON INTEREST THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THESE PAPERS MAY NEVER REACH YOU YET I CANNOT FORBEAR RECORDING IT WE ARE STILL SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS OF ICE STILL IN IMMINENT DANGER OF BEING CRUSHED IN THEIR CONFLICT THE COLD IS EXCESSIVE AND MANY OF MY UNFORTUNATE COMRADES HAVE ALREADY FOUND A GRAVE AMIDST THIS SCENE OF DESOLATION FRANKENSTEIN HAS DAILY DECLINED IN HEALTH A FEVERISH FIRE STILL GLIMMERS IN HIS EYES BUT HE IS EXHAUSTED AND WHEN SUDDENLY ROUSED TO ANY EXERTION HE SPEEDILY SINKS AGAIN INTO APPARENT LIFELESSNESS I MENTIONED IN MY LAST LETTER THE FEARS I ENTERTAINED OF A MUTINY THIS MORNING AS I SAT WATCHING THE WAN COUNTENANCE OF MY FRIEND HIS EYES HALF CLOSED AND HIS LIMBS HANGING LISTLESSLY I WAS ROUSED BY HALF A DOZEN OF THE SAILORS WHO DEMANDED ADMISSION INTO THE CABIN THEY ENTERED AND THEIR LEADER ADDRESSED ME HE TOLD ME THAT HE AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY THE OTHER SAILORS TO COME IN DEPUTATION TO ME TO MAKE ME A REQUISITION WHICH IN JUSTICE I COULD NOT REFUSE WE WERE IMMURED IN ICE AND SHOULD PROBABLY NEVER ESCAPE BUT THEY FEARED THAT IF AS WAS POSSIBLE THE ICE SHOULD DISSIPATE AND A FREE PASSAGE BE OPENED I SHOULD BE RASH ENOUGH TO CONTINUE MY VOYAGE AND LEAD THEM INTO FRESH DANGERS AFTER THEY MIGHT HAPPILY HAVE SURMOUNTED THIS THEY INSISTED THEREFORE THAT I SHOULD ENGAGE WITH A SOLEMN PROMISE THAT IF THE VESSEL SHOULD BE FREED I WOULD INSTANTLY DIRECT MY COURSE SOUTHWARDS THIS SPEECH TROUBLED ME I HAD NOT DESPAIRED NOR HAD I YET CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF RETURNING IF SET FREE YET COULD I IN JUSTICE OR EVEN IN POSSIBILITY REFUSE THIS DEMAND I HESITATED BEFORE I ANSWERED WHEN FRANKENSTEIN WHO HAD AT FIRST BEEN SILENT AND INDEED APPEARED HARDLY TO HAVE FORCE ENOUGH TO ATTEND NOW ROUSED HIMSELF HIS EYES SPARKLED AND HIS CHEEKS FLUSHED WITH MOMENTARY VIGOUR TURNING TOWARDS THE MEN HE SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DO YOU DEMAND OF YOUR CAPTAIN ARE YOU THEN SO EASILY TURNED FROM YOUR DESIGN DID YOU NOT CALL THIS A GLORIOUS EXPEDITION AND WHEREFORE WAS IT GLORIOUS NOT BECAUSE THE WAY WAS SMOOTH AND PLACID AS A SOUTHERN SEA BUT BECAUSE IT WAS FULL OF DANGERS AND TERROR BECAUSE AT EVERY NEW INCIDENT YOUR FORTITUDE WAS TO BE CALLED FORTH AND YOUR COURAGE EXHIBITED BECAUSE DANGER AND DEATH SURROUNDED IT AND THESE YOU WERE TO BRAVE AND OVERCOME FOR THIS WAS IT A GLORIOUS FOR THIS WAS IT AN HONOURABLE UNDERTAKING YOU WERE HEREAFTER TO BE HAILED AS THE BENEFACTORS OF YOUR SPECIES YOUR NAMES ADORED AS BELONGING TO BRAVE MEN WHO ENCOUNTERED DEATH FOR HONOUR AND THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND AND NOW BEHOLD WITH THE FIRST IMAGINATION OF DANGER OR IF YOU WILL THE FIRST MIGHTY AND TERRIFIC TRIAL OF YOUR COURAGE YOU SHRINK AWAY AND ARE CONTENT TO BE HANDED DOWN AS MEN WHO HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO ENDURE COLD AND PERIL AND SO POOR SOULS THEY WERE CHILLY AND RETURNED TO THEIR WARM FIRESIDES WHY THAT REQUIRES NOT THIS PREPARATION YE NEED NOT HAVE COME THUS FAR AND DRAGGED YOUR CAPTAIN TO THE SHAME OF A DEFEAT MERELY TO PROVE YOURSELVES COWARDS OH BE MEN OR BE MORE THAN MEN BE STEADY TO YOUR PURPOSES AND FIRM AS A ROCK THIS ICE IS NOT MADE OF SUCH STUFF AS YOUR HEARTS MAY BE IT IS MUTABLE AND CANNOT WITHSTAND YOU IF YOU SAY THAT IT SHALL NOT DO NOT RETURN TO YOUR FAMILIES WITH THE STIGMA OF DISGRACE MARKED ON YOUR BROWS RETURN AS HEROES WHO HAVE FOUGHT AND CONQUERED AND WHO KNOW NOT WHAT IT IS TO TURN THEIR BACKS ON THE FOE HE SPOKE THIS WITH A VOICE SO MODULATED TO THE DIFFERENT FEELINGS EXPRESSED IN HIS SPEECH WITH AN EYE SO FULL OF LOFTY DESIGN AND HEROISM THAT CAN YOU WONDER THAT THESE MEN WERE MOVED THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND WERE UNABLE TO REPLY I SPOKE I TOLD THEM TO RETIRE AND CONSIDER OF WHAT HAD BEEN SAID THAT I WOULD NOT LEAD THEM FARTHER NORTH IF THEY STRENUOUSLY DESIRED THE CONTRARY BUT THAT I HOPED THAT WITH REFLECTION THEIR COURAGE WOULD RETURN THEY RETIRED AND I TURNED TOWARDS MY FRIEND BUT HE WAS SUNK IN LANGUOR AND ALMOST DEPRIVED OF LIFE HOW ALL THIS WILL TERMINATE I KNOW NOT BUT I HAD RATHER DIE THAN RETURN SHAMEFULLY MY PURPOSE UNFULFILLED YET I FEAR SUCH WILL BE MY FATE THE MEN UNSUPPORTED BY IDEAS OF GLORY AND HONOUR CAN NEVER WILLINGLY CONTINUE TO ENDURE THEIR PRESENT HARDSHIPS SEPTEMBER TH THE DIE IS CAST I HAVE CONSENTED TO RETURN IF WE ARE NOT DESTROYED THUS ARE MY HOPES BLASTED BY COWARDICE AND INDECISION I COME BACK IGNORANT AND DISAPPOINTED IT REQUIRES MORE PHILOSOPHY THAN I POSSESS TO BEAR THIS INJUSTICE WITH PATIENCE SEPTEMBER TH IT IS PAST I AM RETURNING TO ENGLAND I HAVE LOST MY HOPES OF UTILITY AND GLORY I HAVE LOST MY FRIEND BUT I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DETAIL THESE BITTER CIRCUMSTANCES TO YOU MY DEAR SISTER AND WHILE I AM WAFTED TOWARDS ENGLAND AND TOWARDS YOU I WILL NOT DESPOND SEPTEMBER TH THE ICE BEGAN TO MOVE AND ROARINGS LIKE THUNDER WERE HEARD AT A DISTANCE AS THE ISLANDS SPLIT AND CRACKED IN EVERY DIRECTION WE WERE IN THE MOST IMMINENT PERIL BUT AS WE COULD ONLY REMAIN PASSIVE MY CHIEF ATTENTION WAS OCCUPIED BY MY UNFORTUNATE GUEST WHOSE ILLNESS INCREASED IN SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE WAS ENTIRELY CONFINED TO HIS BED THE ICE CRACKED BEHIND US AND WAS DRIVEN WITH FORCE TOWARDS THE NORTH A BREEZE SPRANG FROM THE WEST AND ON THE TH THE PASSAGE TOWARDS THE SOUTH BECAME PERFECTLY FREE WHEN THE SAILORS SAW THIS AND THAT THEIR RETURN TO THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY WAS APPARENTLY ASSURED A SHOUT OF TUMULTUOUS JOY BROKE FROM THEM LOUD AND LONG CONTINUED FRANKENSTEIN WHO WAS DOZING AWOKE AND ASKED THE CAUSE OF THE TUMULT THEY SHOUT I SAID BECAUSE THEY WILL SOON RETURN TO ENGLAND DO YOU THEN REALLY RETURN ALAS YES I CANNOT WITHSTAND THEIR DEMANDS I CANNOT LEAD THEM UNWILLINGLY TO DANGER AND I MUST RETURN DO SO IF YOU WILL BUT I WILL NOT YOU MAY GIVE UP YOUR PURPOSE BUT MINE IS ASSIGNED TO ME BY HEAVEN AND I DARE NOT I AM WEAK BUT SURELY THE SPIRITS WHO ASSIST MY VENGEANCE WILL ENDOW ME WITH SUFFICIENT STRENGTH SAYING THIS HE ENDEAVOURED TO SPRING FROM THE BED BUT THE EXERTION WAS TOO GREAT FOR HIM HE FELL BACK AND FAINTED IT WAS LONG BEFORE HE WAS RESTORED AND I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT LIFE WAS ENTIRELY EXTINCT AT LENGTH HE OPENED HIS EYES HE BREATHED WITH DIFFICULTY AND WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK THE SURGEON GAVE HIM A COMPOSING DRAUGHT AND ORDERED US TO LEAVE HIM UNDISTURBED IN THE MEANTIME HE TOLD ME THAT MY FRIEND HAD CERTAINLY NOT MANY HOURS TO LIVE HIS SENTENCE WAS PRONOUNCED AND I COULD ONLY GRIEVE AND BE PATIENT I SAT BY HIS BED WATCHING HIM HIS EYES WERE CLOSED AND I THOUGHT HE SLEPT BUT PRESENTLY HE CALLED TO ME IN A FEEBLE VOICE AND BIDDING ME COME NEAR SAID ALAS THE STRENGTH I RELIED ON IS GONE I FEEL THAT I SHALL SOON DIE AND HE MY ENEMY AND PERSECUTOR MAY STILL BE IN BEING THINK NOT WALTON THAT IN THE LAST MOMENTS OF MY EXISTENCE I FEEL THAT BURNING HATRED AND ARDENT DESIRE OF REVENGE I ONCE EXPRESSED BUT I FEEL MYSELF JUSTIFIED IN DESIRING THE DEATH OF MY ADVERSARY DURING THESE LAST DAYS I HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN EXAMINING MY PAST CONDUCT NOR DO I FIND IT BLAMABLE IN A FIT OF ENTHUSIASTIC MADNESS I CREATED A RATIONAL CREATURE AND WAS BOUND TOWARDS HIM TO ASSURE AS FAR AS WAS IN MY POWER HIS HAPPINESS AND WELL BEING THIS WAS MY DUTY BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER STILL PARAMOUNT TO THAT MY DUTIES TOWARDS THE BEINGS OF MY OWN SPECIES HAD GREATER CLAIMS TO MY ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY INCLUDED A GREATER PROPORTION OF HAPPINESS OR MISERY URGED BY THIS VIEW I REFUSED AND I DID RIGHT IN REFUSING TO CREATE A COMPANION FOR THE FIRST CREATURE HE SHOWED UNPARALLELED MALIGNITY AND SELFISHNESS IN EVIL HE DESTROYED MY FRIENDS HE DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION BEINGS WHO POSSESSED EXQUISITE SENSATIONS HAPPINESS AND WISDOM NOR DO I KNOW WHERE THIS THIRST FOR VENGEANCE MAY END MISERABLE HIMSELF THAT HE MAY RENDER NO OTHER WRETCHED HE OUGHT TO DIE THE TASK OF HIS DESTRUCTION WAS MINE BUT I HAVE FAILED WHEN ACTUATED BY SELFISH AND VICIOUS MOTIVES I ASKED YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY UNFINISHED WORK AND I RENEW THIS REQUEST NOW WHEN I AM ONLY INDUCED BY REASON AND VIRTUE YET I CANNOT ASK YOU TO RENOUNCE YOUR COUNTRY AND FRIENDS TO FULFIL THIS TASK AND NOW THAT YOU ARE RETURNING TO ENGLAND YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF MEETING WITH HIM BUT THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE POINTS AND THE WELL BALANCING OF WHAT YOU MAY ESTEEM YOUR DUTIES I LEAVE TO YOU MY JUDGMENT AND IDEAS ARE ALREADY DISTURBED BY THE NEAR APPROACH OF DEATH I DARE NOT ASK YOU TO DO WHAT I THINK RIGHT FOR I MAY STILL BE MISLED BY PASSION THAT HE SHOULD LIVE TO BE AN INSTRUMENT OF MISCHIEF DISTURBS ME IN OTHER RESPECTS THIS HOUR WHEN I MOMENTARILY EXPECT MY RELEASE IS THE ONLY HAPPY ONE WHICH I HAVE ENJOYED FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE FORMS OF THE BELOVED DEAD FLIT BEFORE ME AND I HASTEN TO THEIR ARMS FAREWELL WALTON SEEK HAPPINESS IN TRANQUILLITY AND AVOID AMBITION EVEN IF IT BE ONLY THE APPARENTLY INNOCENT ONE OF DISTINGUISHING YOURSELF IN SCIENCE AND DISCOVERIES YET WHY DO I SAY THIS I HAVE MYSELF BEEN BLASTED IN THESE HOPES YET ANOTHER MAY SUCCEED HIS VOICE BECAME FAINTER AS HE SPOKE AND AT LENGTH EXHAUSTED BY HIS EFFORT HE SANK INTO SILENCE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE ATTEMPTED AGAIN TO SPEAK BUT WAS UNABLE HE PRESSED MY HAND FEEBLY AND HIS EYES CLOSED FOR EVER WHILE THE IRRADIATION OF A GENTLE SMILE PASSED AWAY FROM HIS LIPS MARGARET WHAT COMMENT CAN I MAKE ON THE UNTIMELY EXTINCTION OF THIS GLORIOUS SPIRIT WHAT CAN I SAY THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH OF MY SORROW ALL THAT I SHOULD EXPRESS WOULD BE INADEQUATE AND FEEBLE MY TEARS FLOW MY MIND IS OVERSHADOWED BY A CLOUD OF DISAPPOINTMENT BUT I JOURNEY TOWARDS ENGLAND AND I MAY THERE FIND CONSOLATION I AM INTERRUPTED WHAT DO THESE SOUNDS PORTEND IT IS MIDNIGHT THE BREEZE BLOWS FAIRLY AND THE WATCH ON DECK SCARCELY STIR AGAIN THERE IS A SOUND AS OF A HUMAN VOICE BUT HOARSER IT COMES FROM THE CABIN WHERE THE REMAINS OF FRANKENSTEIN STILL LIE I MUST ARISE AND EXAMINE GOOD NIGHT MY SISTER GREAT GOD WHAT A SCENE HAS JUST TAKEN PLACE I AM YET DIZZY WITH THE REMEMBRANCE OF IT I HARDLY KNOW WHETHER I SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO DETAIL IT YET THE TALE WHICH I HAVE RECORDED WOULD BE INCOMPLETE WITHOUT THIS FINAL AND WONDERFUL CATASTROPHE I ENTERED THE CABIN WHERE LAY THE REMAINS OF MY ILL FATED AND ADMIRABLE FRIEND OVER HIM HUNG A FORM WHICH I CANNOT FIND WORDS TO DESCRIBE GIGANTIC IN STATURE YET UNCOUTH AND DISTORTED IN ITS PROPORTIONS AS HE HUNG OVER THE COFFIN HIS FACE WAS CONCEALED BY LONG LOCKS OF RAGGED HAIR BUT ONE VAST HAND WAS EXTENDED IN COLOUR AND APPARENT TEXTURE LIKE THAT OF A MUMMY WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF MY APPROACH HE CEASED TO UTTER EXCLAMATIONS OF GRIEF AND HORROR AND SPRUNG TOWARDS THE WINDOW NEVER DID I BEHOLD A VISION SO HORRIBLE AS HIS FACE OF SUCH LOATHSOME YET APPALLING HIDEOUSNESS I SHUT MY EYES INVOLUNTARILY AND ENDEAVOURED TO RECOLLECT WHAT WERE MY DUTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS DESTROYER I CALLED ON HIM TO STAY HE PAUSED LOOKING ON ME WITH WONDER AND AGAIN TURNING TOWARDS THE LIFELESS FORM OF HIS CREATOR HE SEEMED TO FORGET MY PRESENCE AND EVERY FEATURE AND GESTURE SEEMED INSTIGATED BY THE WILDEST RAGE OF SOME UNCONTROLLABLE PASSION THAT IS ALSO MY VICTIM HE EXCLAIMED IN HIS MURDER MY CRIMES ARE CONSUMMATED THE MISERABLE SERIES OF MY BEING IS WOUND TO ITS CLOSE OH FRANKENSTEIN GENEROUS AND SELF DEVOTED BEING WHAT DOES IT AVAIL THAT I NOW ASK THEE TO PARDON ME I WHO IRRETRIEVABLY DESTROYED THEE BY DESTROYING ALL THOU LOVEDST ALAS HE IS COLD HE CANNOT ANSWER ME HIS VOICE SEEMED SUFFOCATED AND MY FIRST IMPULSES WHICH HAD SUGGESTED TO ME THE DUTY OF OBEYING THE DYING REQUEST OF MY FRIEND IN DESTROYING HIS ENEMY WERE NOW SUSPENDED BY A MIXTURE OF CURIOSITY AND COMPASSION I APPROACHED THIS TREMENDOUS BEING I DARED NOT AGAIN RAISE MY EYES TO HIS FACE THERE WAS SOMETHING SO SCARING AND UNEARTHLY IN HIS UGLINESS I ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK BUT THE WORDS DIED AWAY ON MY LIPS THE MONSTER CONTINUED TO UTTER WILD AND INCOHERENT SELF REPROACHES AT LENGTH I GATHERED RESOLUTION TO ADDRESS HIM IN A PAUSE OF THE TEMPEST OF HIS PASSION YOUR REPENTANCE I SAID IS NOW SUPERFLUOUS IF YOU HAD LISTENED TO THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE AND HEEDED THE STINGS OF REMORSE BEFORE YOU HAD URGED YOUR DIABOLICAL VENGEANCE TO THIS EXTREMITY FRANKENSTEIN WOULD YET HAVE LIVED AND DO YOU DREAM SAID THE D MON DO YOU THINK THAT I WAS THEN DEAD TO AGONY AND REMORSE HE HE CONTINUED POINTING TO THE CORPSE HE SUFFERED NOT IN THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DEED OH NOT THE TEN THOUSANDTH PORTION OF THE ANGUISH THAT WAS MINE DURING THE LINGERING DETAIL OF ITS EXECUTION A FRIGHTFUL SELFISHNESS HURRIED ME ON WHILE MY HEART WAS POISONED WITH REMORSE THINK YOU THAT THE GROANS OF CLERVAL WERE MUSIC TO MY EARS MY HEART WAS FASHIONED TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND WHEN WRENCHED BY MISERY TO VICE AND HATRED IT DID NOT ENDURE THE VIOLENCE OF THE CHANGE WITHOUT TORTURE SUCH AS YOU CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE AFTER THE MURDER OF CLERVAL I RETURNED TO SWITZERLAND HEART BROKEN AND OVERCOME I PITIED FRANKENSTEIN MY PITY AMOUNTED TO HORROR I ABHORRED MYSELF BUT WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT HE THE AUTHOR AT ONCE OF MY EXISTENCE AND OF ITS UNSPEAKABLE TORMENTS DARED TO HOPE FOR HAPPINESS THAT WHILE HE ACCUMULATED WRETCHEDNESS AND DESPAIR UPON ME HE SOUGHT HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN FEELINGS AND PASSIONS FROM THE INDULGENCE OF WHICH I WAS FOR EVER BARRED THEN IMPOTENT ENVY AND BITTER INDIGNATION FILLED ME WITH AN INSATIABLE THIRST FOR VENGEANCE I RECOLLECTED MY THREAT AND RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED I KNEW THAT I WAS PREPARING FOR MYSELF A DEADLY TORTURE BUT I WAS THE SLAVE NOT THE MASTER OF AN IMPULSE WHICH I DETESTED YET COULD NOT DISOBEY YET WHEN SHE DIED NAY THEN I WAS NOT MISERABLE I HAD CAST OFF ALL FEELING SUBDUED ALL ANGUISH TO RIOT IN THE EXCESS OF MY DESPAIR EVIL THENCEFORTH BECAME MY GOOD URGED THUS FAR I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ADAPT MY NATURE TO AN ELEMENT WHICH I HAD WILLINGLY CHOSEN THE COMPLETION OF MY DEMONIACAL DESIGN BECAME AN INSATIABLE PASSION AND NOW IT IS ENDED THERE IS MY LAST VICTIM I WAS AT FIRST TOUCHED BY THE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS MISERY YET WHEN I CALLED TO MIND WHAT FRANKENSTEIN HAD SAID OF HIS POWERS OF ELOQUENCE AND PERSUASION AND WHEN I AGAIN CAST MY EYES ON THE LIFELESS FORM OF MY FRIEND INDIGNATION WAS REKINDLED WITHIN ME WRETCH I SAID IT IS WELL THAT YOU COME HERE TO WHINE OVER THE DESOLATION THAT YOU HAVE MADE YOU THROW A TORCH INTO A PILE OF BUILDINGS AND WHEN THEY ARE CONSUMED YOU SIT AMONG THE RUINS AND LAMENT THE FALL HYPOCRITICAL FIEND IF HE WHOM YOU MOURN STILL LIVED STILL WOULD HE BE THE OBJECT AGAIN WOULD HE BECOME THE PREY OF YOUR ACCURSED VENGEANCE IT IS NOT PITY THAT YOU FEEL YOU LAMENT ONLY BECAUSE THE VICTIM OF YOUR MALIGNITY IS WITHDRAWN FROM YOUR POWER OH IT IS NOT THUS NOT THUS INTERRUPTED THE BEING YET SUCH MUST BE THE IMPRESSION CONVEYED TO YOU BY WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE PURPORT OF MY ACTIONS YET I SEEK NOT A FELLOW FEELING IN MY MISERY NO SYMPATHY MAY I EVER FIND WHEN I FIRST SOUGHT IT IT WAS THE LOVE OF VIRTUE THE FEELINGS OF HAPPINESS AND AFFECTION WITH WHICH MY WHOLE BEING OVERFLOWED THAT I WISHED TO BE PARTICIPATED BUT NOW THAT VIRTUE HAS BECOME TO ME A SHADOW AND THAT HAPPINESS AND AFFECTION ARE TURNED INTO BITTER AND LOATHING DESPAIR IN WHAT SHOULD I SEEK FOR SYMPATHY I AM CONTENT TO SUFFER ALONE WHILE MY SUFFERINGS SHALL ENDURE WHEN I DIE I AM WELL SATISFIED THAT ABHORRENCE AND OPPROBRIUM SHOULD LOAD MY MEMORY ONCE MY FANCY WAS SOOTHED WITH DREAMS OF VIRTUE OF FAME AND OF ENJOYMENT ONCE I FALSELY HOPED TO MEET WITH BEINGS WHO PARDONING MY OUTWARD FORM WOULD LOVE ME FOR THE EXCELLENT QUALITIES WHICH I WAS CAPABLE OF UNFOLDING I WAS NOURISHED WITH HIGH THOUGHTS OF HONOUR AND DEVOTION BUT NOW CRIME HAS DEGRADED ME BENEATH THE MEANEST ANIMAL NO GUILT NO MISCHIEF NO MALIGNITY NO MISERY CAN BE FOUND COMPARABLE TO MINE WHEN I RUN OVER THE FRIGHTFUL CATALOGUE OF MY SINS I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I AM THE SAME CREATURE WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ONCE FILLED WITH SUBLIME AND TRANSCENDENT VISIONS OF THE BEAUTY AND THE MAJESTY OF GOODNESS BUT IT IS EVEN SO THE FALLEN ANGEL BECOMES A MALIGNANT DEVIL YET EVEN THAT ENEMY OF GOD AND MAN HAD FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES IN HIS DESOLATION I AM ALONE YOU WHO CALL FRANKENSTEIN YOUR FRIEND SEEM TO HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF MY CRIMES AND HIS MISFORTUNES BUT IN THE DETAIL WHICH HE GAVE YOU OF THEM HE COULD NOT SUM UP THE HOURS AND MONTHS OF MISERY WHICH I ENDURED WASTING IN IMPOTENT PASSIONS FOR WHILE I DESTROYED HIS HOPES I DID NOT SATISFY MY OWN DESIRES THEY WERE FOR EVER ARDENT AND CRAVING STILL I DESIRED LOVE AND FELLOWSHIP AND I WAS STILL SPURNED WAS THERE NO INJUSTICE IN THIS AM I TO BE THOUGHT THE ONLY CRIMINAL WHEN ALL HUMANKIND SINNED AGAINST ME WHY DO YOU NOT HATE FELIX WHO DROVE HIS FRIEND FROM HIS DOOR WITH CONTUMELY WHY DO YOU NOT EXECRATE THE RUSTIC WHO SOUGHT TO DESTROY THE SAVIOUR OF HIS CHILD NAY THESE ARE VIRTUOUS AND IMMACULATE BEINGS I THE MISERABLE AND THE ABANDONED AM AN ABORTION TO BE SPURNED AT AND KICKED AND TRAMPLED ON EVEN NOW MY BLOOD BOILS AT THE RECOLLECTION OF THIS INJUSTICE BUT IT IS TRUE THAT I AM A WRETCH I HAVE MURDERED THE LOVELY AND THE HELPLESS I HAVE STRANGLED THE INNOCENT AS THEY SLEPT AND GRASPED TO DEATH HIS THROAT WHO NEVER INJURED ME OR ANY OTHER LIVING THING I HAVE DEVOTED MY CREATOR THE SELECT SPECIMEN OF ALL THAT IS WORTHY OF LOVE AND ADMIRATION AMONG MEN TO MISERY I HAVE PURSUED HIM EVEN TO THAT IRREMEDIABLE RUIN THERE HE LIES WHITE AND COLD IN DEATH YOU HATE ME BUT YOUR ABHORRENCE CANNOT EQUAL THAT WITH WHICH I REGARD MYSELF I LOOK ON THE HANDS WHICH EXECUTED THE DEED I THINK ON THE HEART IN WHICH THE IMAGINATION OF IT WAS CONCEIVED AND LONG FOR THE MOMENT WHEN THESE HANDS WILL MEET MY EYES WHEN THAT IMAGINATION WILL HAUNT MY THOUGHTS NO MORE FEAR NOT THAT I SHALL BE THE INSTRUMENT OF FUTURE MISCHIEF MY WORK IS NEARLY COMPLETE NEITHER YOURS NOR ANY MAN S DEATH IS NEEDED TO CONSUMMATE THE SERIES OF MY BEING AND ACCOMPLISH THAT WHICH MUST BE DONE BUT IT REQUIRES MY OWN DO NOT THINK THAT I SHALL BE SLOW TO PERFORM THIS SACRIFICE I SHALL QUIT YOUR VESSEL ON THE ICE RAFT WHICH BROUGHT ME THITHER AND SHALL SEEK THE MOST NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE GLOBE I SHALL COLLECT MY FUNERAL PILE AND CONSUME TO ASHES THIS MISERABLE FRAME THAT ITS REMAINS MAY AFFORD NO LIGHT TO ANY CURIOUS AND UNHALLOWED WRETCH WHO WOULD CREATE SUCH ANOTHER AS I HAVE BEEN I SHALL DIE I SHALL NO LONGER FEEL THE AGONIES WHICH NOW CONSUME ME OR BE THE PREY OF FEELINGS UNSATISFIED YET UNQUENCHED HE IS DEAD WHO CALLED ME INTO BEING AND WHEN I SHALL BE NO MORE THE VERY REMEMBRANCE OF US BOTH WILL SPEEDILY VANISH I SHALL NO LONGER SEE THE SUN OR STARS OR FEEL THE WINDS PLAY ON MY CHEEKS LIGHT FEELING AND SENSE WILL PASS AWAY AND IN THIS CONDITION MUST I FIND MY HAPPINESS SOME YEARS AGO WHEN THE IMAGES WHICH THIS WORLD AFFORDS FIRST OPENED UPON ME WHEN I FELT THE CHEERING WARMTH OF SUMMER AND HEARD THE RUSTLING OF THE LEAVES AND THE WARBLING OF THE BIRDS AND THESE WERE ALL TO ME I SHOULD HAVE WEPT TO DIE NOW IT IS MY ONLY CONSOLATION POLLUTED BY CRIMES AND TORN BY THE BITTEREST REMORSE WHERE CAN I FIND REST BUT IN DEATH FAREWELL I LEAVE YOU AND IN YOU THE LAST OF HUMANKIND WHOM THESE EYES WILL EVER BEHOLD FAREWELL FRANKENSTEIN IF THOU WERT YET ALIVE AND YET CHERISHED A DESIRE OF REVENGE AGAINST ME IT WOULD BE BETTER SATIATED IN MY LIFE THAN IN MY DESTRUCTION BUT IT WAS NOT SO THOU DIDST SEEK MY EXTINCTION THAT I MIGHT NOT CAUSE GREATER WRETCHEDNESS AND IF YET IN SOME MODE UNKNOWN TO ME THOU HADST NOT CEASED TO THINK AND FEEL THOU WOULDST NOT DESIRE AGAINST ME A VENGEANCE GREATER THAN THAT WHICH I FEEL BLASTED AS THOU WERT MY AGONY WAS STILL SUPERIOR TO THINE FOR THE BITTER STING OF REMORSE WILL NOT CEASE TO RANKLE IN MY WOUNDS UNTIL DEATH SHALL CLOSE THEM FOR EVER BUT SOON HE CRIED WITH SAD AND SOLEMN ENTHUSIASM I SHALL DIE AND WHAT I NOW FEEL BE NO LONGER FELT SOON THESE BURNING MISERIES WILL BE EXTINCT I SHALL ASCEND MY FUNERAL PILE TRIUMPHANTLY AND EXULT IN THE AGONY OF THE TORTURING FLAMES THE LIGHT OF THAT CONFLAGRATION WILL FADE AWAY MY ASHES WILL BE SWEPT INTO THE SEA BY THE WINDS MY SPIRIT WILL SLEEP IN PEACE OR IF IT THINKS IT WILL NOT SURELY THINK THUS FAREWELL HE SPRANG FROM THE CABIN WINDOW AS HE SAID THIS UPON THE ICE RAFT WHICH LAY CLOSE TO THE VESSEL HE WAS SOON BORNE AWAY BY THE
